# Learning Calculus

In order to learn calculus I decided to make this repo so as to save and document all of the work which I have done.

By no means should someone use this as a guide, its just how I learnt it.

# What is Calculus?

The difference between regular math and calculus: In a word, its the curve.

Calculus is that the mathematics of change.

# Real world examples calculus

You can calculate the area of the flat roof of a home with regular math.

With calculus you can compute the area of a complicated, nonspherical shape like the dome of a building.

# Diferentiation and Integration

## Diferentiation

Differentiation is the process of finding a derivative, and the derivative of a curve is just the fancy calculus term for the curve's slope of steepness; the slope of a curve is also a simple rate like miles per hour or profit per item.

## Integration

Integration is the second big idea in calculus, and is basically just fancy addition. Integration is the process of cutting up an area into tiny sections, figuring the areas of the small sections, and then adding up the little bits of area to get the whole area.

### Yeno's Paradoxes

It seems that it may be worth while reading through this document to understand things a bit further.

# Why Calculus Works

* Using limits to zoom in on curves
* Slope equals rise over run
* Area of a triangle equals one-half base times height
* The Pythagoreans theorem: a²+ b² = c²

# Pre-Algebra and Algebra Review

The deominator of a fraction can never equal zero.

```
0/5 equals to zero, but 5/0 is undefined
```
The ```reciprocal```of a number od expression is it multiplicative inverse -- whic is a fancy way of sayig that the prdocut of somethins is reciprocal is 1.

To get the reciprocal of a fraction, flip it upside down. Thus, the reciprocal of ```3/4 is 4/3```, the reciprocal of ```6```, which equals ```6/1```, is ```1/6,``` and the reciprocal of ```x - 2 ```is ```1/x-2```.

### Power Rule

>x<sup>0</sup> = 1

This it the rule regardless of what ```x``` equals -- a fraction, a negative, anything -- except for zero (zero raised to the zero power is ```undefined```)

>x<sup>0</sup> = 1

>0<sup>0</sup> = undefined

#### Examples

>x<sup>-3</sup> = 1&frasl;x<sup>3</sup>

>x<sup>-a</sup> = 1&frasl;x<sup>a</sup>


>4<sup>-2</sup> = 1&frasl;4<sup>2</sup> =  1&frasl;16 

This part definitely needs more working on and possibly a seperate repo to learn more.

### Square Roots


The mathematical expression "The (principal) square root of x"

For example, √25 = 5, since 25 = 5⋅5, or 52 (5 squared).
In mathematics, a square root of a number a is a number y such that y2 = a; in other words, a number y whose square (the result of multiplying the number by itself, or y⋅y) is a.[1] For example, 4 and −4 are square roots of 16 because 42 = (−4)2 = 16. Every nonnegative real number a has a unique nonnegative square root, called the principal square root, which is denoted by √a, where √ is called the radical sign or radix. For example, the principal square root of 9 is 3, which is denoted by √9 = 3, because 32 = 3 • 3 = 9 and 3 is nonnegative. The term (or number) whose square root is being considered is known as the radicand. The radicand is the number or expression underneath the radical sign, in this example 9.

Every positive number a has two square roots: √a, which is positive, and −√a, which is negative. Together, these two roots are denoted as ±√a (see ± shorthand). Although the principal square root of a positive number is only one of its two square roots, the designation "the square root" is often used to refer to the principal square root. For positive a, the principal square root can also be written in exponent notation, as a1/2.[2]

Square roots of negative numbers can be discussed within the framework of complex numbers. More generally, square roots can be considered in any context in which a notion of "squaring" of some mathematical objects is defined (including algebras of matrices, endomorphism rings, etc.)

### Logarithms

In mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse function to exponentiation. That means the logarithm of a given number x is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base b, must be raised, to produce that number x. In the simplest case the logarithm counts repeated multiplication of the same factor; e.g., since 1000 = 10 × 10 × 10 = 103, the "logarithm to base 10" of 1000 is 3. The logarithm of x to base b is denoted as logb (x) (or, without parentheses, as logb x, or even without explicit base as log x, when no confusion is possible). More generally, exponentiation allows any positive real number to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so the logarithm for any two positive real numbers b and x where b is not equal to 1, is always a unique real number y. More explicitly, the defining relation between exponentiation and logarithm is:

> log<sub>b</sub>(x) = y &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exactly if &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b<sup>y</sup> = x
