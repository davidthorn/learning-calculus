# Learning Calculus

In order to learn calculus I decided to make this repo so as to save and document all of the work which I have done.

By no means should someone use this as a guide, its just how I learnt it.

# What is Calculus?

The difference between regular math and calculus: In a word, its the curve.

Calculus is that the mathematics of change.

# Real world examples calculus

* You can calculate the area of the flat roof of a home with regular math.
* With calculus you can compute the area of a complicated, nonspherical shape like the dome of a building.
