# Learning Calculus

In order to learn calculus I decided to make this repo so as to save and document all of the work which I have done.

By no means should someone use this as a guide, its just how I learnt it.

# What is Calculus?

The difference between regular math and calculus: In a word, its the curve.

Calculus is that the mathematics of change.

# Real world examples calculus

You can calculate the area of the flat roof of a home with regular math.

With calculus you can compute the area of a complicated, nonspherical shape like the dome of a building.

# Diferentiation and Integration

## Diferentiation

Differentiation is the process of finding a derivative, and the derivative of a curve is just the fancy calculus term for the curve's slope of steepness; the slope of a curve is also a simple rate like miles per hour or profit per item.

## Integration

Integration is the second big idea in calculus, and is basically just fancy addition. Integration is the process of cutting up an area into tiny sections, figuring the areas of the small sections, and then adding up the little bits of area to get the whole area.

### Yeno's Paradoxes

It seems that it may be worth while reading through this document to understand things a bit further.

[Zeno's Paradoxes](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#ParPlu)

# Why Calculus Works

* Using limits to zoom in on curves
* Slope equals rise over run
* Area of a triangle equals one-half base times height
* The Pythagoreans theorem: aÂ²+ bÂ² = cÂ²

# Pre-Algebra and Algebra Review

The deominator of a fraction can never equal zero.

```
0/5 equals to zero, but 5/0 is undefined
```
The ```reciprocal```of a number od expression is it multiplicative inverse -- whic is a fancy way of sayig that the prdocut of somethins is reciprocal is 1.

To get the reciprocal of a fraction, flip it upside down. Thus, the reciprocal of ```3/4 is 4/3```, the reciprocal of ```6```, which equals ```6/1```, is ```1/6,``` and the reciprocal of ```x - 2 ```is ```1/x-2```.

### Power Rule

>x<sup>0</sup> = 1

This it the rule regardless of what ```x``` equals -- a fraction, a negative, anything -- except for zero (zero raised to the zero power is ```undefined```)

>x<sup>0</sup> = 1

>0<sup>0</sup> = undefined
